# About
I do Ui-Library in Roblox , such as Hub development (front-end), and Script development! Most of the projects you may see on here are mostly hobbyist.

This is [**UI Service**](https://discord.gg/VhtxpdnmeF)

```Lua
[Information]
[*] UI Price 500 + THB
[*] UI Open Source 500
```
**New Function**
- [x] Add Blank Function (Settings Padding Between UI) :tada:

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
